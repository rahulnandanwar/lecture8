    "# What is an ensemble method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble is a Machine Learning concept in which the idea is to train multiple models using the same learning algorithm. The ensembles take part in a bigger group of methods, called multiclassifiers, where a set of hundreds or thousands of learners with a common objective are fused together to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second group of multiclassifiers contain the hybrid methods. They use a set of learners too, but they can be trained using different learning techniques. Stacking is the most well-known.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main causes of error in learning are due to noise, bias and variance. Ensemble helps to minimize these factors. These methods are designed to improve the stability and the accuracy of Machine Learning algorithms. Combinations of multiple classifiers decrease variance, especially in the case of unstable classifiers, and may produce a more reliable classification than a single classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging is a homogeneous weak learners’ model that learns from each other independently in parallel and combines them for determining the model average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is also a homogeneous weak learners’ model but works differently from Bagging. In this model, learners learn sequentially and adaptively to improve model predictions of a learning algorithm."

    "### Similarities and Differences between Bagging and Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging and Boosting, both being the popularly used methods, have a universal similarity of being classified as ensemble methods. Here we will highlight more similarities between them, followed by the differences they have from each other. Let us first start with similarities as understanding these will make understanding the differences easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bagging and Boosting: Similarities\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging and Boosting are ensemble methods focused on getting N learners from a single learner.\n",
    "Bagging and Boosting make random sampling and generate several training data sets \n",
    "Bagging and Boosting arrive upon the end decision by making an average of N learners or taking the voting rank done by most of them.\n",
    "Bagging and Boosting reduce variance and provide higher stability with minimizing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bagging and Boosting: Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging is a method of merging the same type of predictions. Boosting is a method of merging different types of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging decreases variance, not bias, and solves over-fitting issues in a model. Boosting decreases bias, not variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bagging, each model receives an equal weight. In Boosting, models are weighed based on their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are built independently in Bagging. New models are affected by a previously built model’s performance in Boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bagging, training data subsets are drawn randomly with a replacement for the training dataset. In Boosting, every new subset comprises the elements that were misclassified by previous models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging is usually applied where the classifier is unstable and has a high variance. Boosting is usually applied where the classifier is stable and simple and has high bias.\n",
